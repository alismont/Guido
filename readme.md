***GUIDO***
	
This is a simple cross mode GUI library for the Processings.
	
Why the heck is it called Guido? ... _GUI, do?_

What does cross mode mean and why "the Processings"?
The future 2.0 Processing will have ["modes"](http://wiki.processing.org/w/JavaScript) which are additional language flavours to write and use Processing in. One is the then included JavaScript mode which is based upon [Processing.js](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js). Guido is an attempt at writing a GUI library that supports both Java and JavaScript, so any sketch using it should run on both modes.
