***GUIDO***
	
This is a simple cross mode GUI library for the Processings.

What does cross mode mean and why "the Processings"?
The future 2.0 Processing will have ["modes"](http://wiki.processing.org/w/JavaScript) which are additional language flavours to write and use Processing in. One is the then included JavaScript mode which is based upon [Processing.js](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js). Guido is an attempt at writing a GUI library that supports both Java and JavaScript, so any sketch using it should run on both modes.
	
***Installing***

As of Processing 2.0 you should use the "Library Manager" built into the PDE. From the menu:
Sketch > Import Library ... > Add Library ...

Select "GUI" from the filter menu at top, or type guido into search.

Select "Guido" in the list and click "Install" button on the right.
 
***Installing manually***

Download [latest](https://github.com/fjenett/Guido/Guido.zip), unzip and move the folder to your sketchbooks "libraries" folder.
